Requirements
Your project must satisfy the following requirements:

Technical Requirements
Be built using Express, Handlebars and Mongoose.
Have at least 2 non-User models
Have complete CRUD functionality implemented with RESTful routes. (You may logically distribute CRUD functionality across models. This is only allowed when it does not make sense in the context of your application to have full CRUD on one model.)
Have its own repository under your GitHub account (do not fork this repo).
Be deployed to Heroku.
Have validated, semantically-clean HTML and CSS and a polished appearance.
Demonstrate a good commit history.
